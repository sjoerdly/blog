Creating customers = not simply making your customers happy.
<h2>Product-market fit</h2>
Creating customers means finding a sustainable <em>product-market</em> fit. When found, the product is a solution for the customers who in turn create a market by their willingness to pay for it. It entails not just <em>making a user happy</em>, but turning a mere user into a <em>paying customer</em>. Turning a random person’s <em>need addressed</em> into a person who is willing to <em>compensate for the need addressed</em>.
<h2>Sustaining the Product</h2>
After finding this first match, we enter into a never ending cycle of keeping the customer, creating more customers, etc. To do this we are continuously re-evaluating product-market fit (product quality), as well as stability (technical quality). The trick is to find a balance, always experimenting how to optimize the value of the Product in a sustainable way. This means distributing our efforts between serving customer needs (building the right thing) and creating a high quality product (building the thing right). In Scrum and some other agile settings, this is one of the main challenges for a Product Owner. Luckily, they don't perform this hard task on their own. To maintain a valuable, sustainable Product, Product Owners work in close collaboration with the Development Team &amp; their Stakeholders.
