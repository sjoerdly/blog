<p>Really? Do we really want to believe that we have to choose between doing things right vs doing things fast? And btw, Agile is not about being fast as a goal itself. It’s all about agility. Being able to test, pivot, and adapt to new insights. Leading to doing the right things, while the continuous improvement&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;lead to increasingly doing things right.</p>

<p>I hate how this approach implies that being Agile makes products and teams less efficient &amp; safe. I hope this kind of ideas doesn’t lead to more half assed agile implementations that stop at a suboptimal level by not being able to effect a company wide change over time.&nbsp;In my experience and from what I see &amp; read around me, the tradeoff mentioned in the Bimodal IT descriptions simply does not exist; Agile teams focus on safety, efficiency and performance just as much, if that is what turns out to be valuable to a company and their people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But maybe I’m blinded by my beliefs. And happy to be proven wrong. :-)</p>
