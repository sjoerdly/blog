<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6297772867199299584">Viktor Grgic asked on linkedin about FIFO or LIFO backlog management</a>. Which one of these options would lead to a better overall delivered product?</p>
My thoughts on this: since you naturally spend more time looking at the top of the backlog, new stuff that is put at the top (LIFO) has to be dealt with quicker, leading to shorter lead times and a cleaner backlog. Stuff that comes in and gets discarded is cleaned up earlier. New work is split up for minimum testable hypothesis and validation of value earlier, etc.

So definitely go for LIFO backlog management IF you have to choose.Â  The reality might be somewhere in the middle, but I'm curious to hear your experiences and thoughts. This idea may help you to keep a healthier, less wasteful more transparent overview of the possible work ahead. So try it!
