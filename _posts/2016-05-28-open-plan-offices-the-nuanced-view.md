<p>FINALLY&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/the-secret-to-an-open-floor-office-your-employees-will-absolutely-love.html">a nuanced view on Open Plan offices and how they&nbsp;<strong>could</strong>&nbsp;benefit certain ways of working</a>. Spoiler alert; very much dependent on the work culture and how the open plan is designed...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>An open plan works when designed in the context of your team's dynamics, work style, industry, and culture.</em></p><p><em>... they don't work if your corporate values are misaligned, and team members haven't developed trust in one another to collaborate at a high level.</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The article then goes into a case study of Menlo innovations, where</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>...open space itself is not the secret sauce; it's the feeling of belonging to a community defined by a shared vision of developing (for Menlo) really good technology for a great return, and doing it in a collaborative spirit.</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Menlo, they try to foster the culture from the start: in their recruitment, they look for candidates who show&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>... good&nbsp;"kindergarten skills," meaning if they don't play well with others in an open space, they're not a good fit.</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really like this comparison... Especially since one of the main collaborative development frameworks I know (Scrum) has been alternatively been described as a game, which gives lots of joy and potentially fantastic outcomes if played well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After this great example, the article warns to keep in mind that the collaborative, open, playful ways of working are not for everyone. It’s a pity though that they also need to mention generational differences, since there’s little actual evidence that age (generation) really matters. The conclusion however, goes for everyone:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>...workers of any breed ... should have some privacy to think, focus, and recharge.</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is what I’ve seen at many places already, having an open plan office while keeping your sanity, there’s a need for enough break out rooms for &nbsp;collaboration (keeping the open plan workable). Three’s a crowd, and crowds are noisy and potentially disturbing the flow(s) of those hard at work (in my experience).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So when you get the chance (or create the chance) to re-design your workplace... start by consulting those who work there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Start by asking yourselves:</em></p><p><em>What do we want to do with our space?<br></em><em>What do we want to get out of our people?<br></em><em>What kind of behavior do we want to encourage?<br></em><em>How can we represent our organization's values?</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get the balance right, based on the needs of those doing the work, as described by those doing the work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Remember that the goal&nbsp;of any office workspace is to support &amp; facilitate doing actual work.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore I wholeheartedly agree with the conclusion:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>...serve the right environment so that you get the best out of them.</p></blockquote>
