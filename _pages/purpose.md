On this page you find the <strong>Purpose</strong> statement of Sjoerd Kranendonk. This is not an 'about' me page. This is more like a <em>Product Vision</em> or a <em>Mission statement. </em>Learn more about the idea of publishing a Purpose statement at <a href="https://slashpurpose.org/">slashpurpose.org</a>
<h2>Better Outcomes through Empricism &amp; Compassion</h2>
I want to contribute to a world where people and organizations address real customer needs by balancing Empiricism &amp; Compassion. Approaching product development in a holistic way, preventing potentially wasteful local optimization, and optimizing our effort to improve the whole.
<h3>Empiricism</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Putting <strong>outcomes</strong> over <em>outputs</em>;</li>
 	<li>Make status, outcomes and plans <strong>transparent</strong> for those involved;</li>
 	<li><strong>Inspect </strong>outcomes, outputs, process and interactions frequently;</li>
 	<li><strong>Adapt</strong> by investing in small steps in the most sensible improvements;</li>
 	<li>Apply knowledge and ideas from Complex Systems thinking, Neuroscience and other evidence based approaches;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compassion</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Connecting</strong> with <strong>customer needs</strong> before moving to a <em>business plan;</em></li>
 	<li><strong>Collaborating</strong> with the <strong>humans</strong> involved by connecting with their <em>needs;</em></li>
 	<li>Focusing on <strong>kindness</strong> over '<em>always being nice</em>'.</li>
</ul>

Be it just for your professional life or extending to a holistic purpose that applies to all you do. A clear purpose helps you focus on doing what is important, selecting who you work with and find more joy and energy in your activities.

At prowareness, each calendar year we create a '(wo)man with a plan' poster. This year (2018) we used the Ikigai format, which lead me to the purpose you find detailed on this page.
