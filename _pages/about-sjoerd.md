<h2>Who about Sjoerd</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a coach, trainer &amp; consultant working with a lean-agile mindset to help people and organizations find better ways of working; less waste, more &amp; faster value delivered and intrinsic motivation. <a href="http://sjoerdly.com/purpose/">My purpose is: "Enabling Better Outcomes through Empricism &amp; Compassion"</a>. I try my best to choose the right tool for the job, using a lean and agile approach in my work while teaching and consulting organizations on theirs. I use my knowledge and experience as <a href="https://www.scrum.org/sjoerd-kranendonk">Professional Scrum Trainer (scrum.org PST)</a>, SAFe Program Consultant (SAFe SPC) &amp; LeSS Practitioner when applicable, but don't hesitate to advise or work with an approach that is new to me. Never stop learning, never stop growing, stumble &amp; get on with it.</p>
