<p>On this page you find the <strong>Purpose</strong> statement of Sjoerd Kranendonk. This is not an '<a href="http://sjoerdly.com/about-sjoerd/">about Sjoerd</a>' page, but <a href="http://sjoerdly.com/about-sjoerd/">I have one of those too</a>. This is more like a <em>Product Vision</em> or a <em>Mission statement. </em>Learn more about the idea of publishing a Purpose statement at <a href="https://slashpurpose.org/">slashpurpose.org</a></p>

<h2>Enabling Better Outcomes through Empiricism &amp; Compassion</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want to contribute to a world where people and organizations address real customer needs by balancing Empiricism &amp; Compassion. Help others approach product development in a holistic way by preventing potentially wasteful local optimization and optimizing our effort to improve the whole.</p>

<p>I believe it can be very helpful to think about your purpose. Be it just for your professional life or extending to a holistic purpose that applies to all you do. A clear purpose helps you focus on doing what is important, selecting who you work with and find more joy and energy in your activities.</p>

<p>At prowareness, each calendar year we create a '(wo)man with a plan' poster. This year (2018) we used the Ikigai format, which lead me to the purpose you find detailed on this page.</p>
