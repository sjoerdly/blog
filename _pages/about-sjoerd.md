What about Sjoerd? Here I hope to share what I'm all about. Activities, goals, links etc. Why I do all this? Check out my Purpose statement.
<h2>Who about Sjoerd</h2>
I am a coach, trainer &amp; consultant working with a lean-agile mindset to help people and organizations find better ways of working; less waste, more &amp; faster value delivered and intrinsic motivation. <a href="http://sjoerdly.com/purpose/">My purpose is: "Enabling Better Outcomes through Empricism &amp; Compassion"</a>. I try my best to choose the right tool for the job, using a lean and agile approach in my work while teaching and consulting organizations on theirs. I use my knowledge and experience as <a href="https://www.scrum.org/sjoerd-kranendonk">Professional Scrum Trainer (scrum.org PST)</a>, SAFe Program Consultant (SAFe SPC) &amp; LeSS Practitioner when applicable, but don't hesitate to advise or work with an approach that is new to me. Never stop learning, never stop growing, stumble &amp; get on with it.
<h2>Collaborate with Sjoerd</h2>
I do this together with my awesome colleagues at Prowareness - We On, the Agile Academy, Scrum.org and all the agilists in my global and local network. This includes people I connect &amp; collaborate with at various clients. Please reach out to learn if there's value in collaborating.
<h2>Connecting with (help from) Sjoerd</h2>
As a connector and aspiring knowledge hub I try to learn together and increase knowledge and understanding of ways to improve our work effectiveness and happiness. The Product Owner Perspective (podcast) is one of the ways I try to help the community while at the same time learning from Product Owner practitioners around the world.

If you want to learn more, have a Proecut Owner or story to share for the podcast or anything else.... reach out on a preferred medium and let's learn together!
