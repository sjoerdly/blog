<p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Product Backlog items that can be "Done" by the Development Team within one Sprint are deemed "Ready" for selection in a Sprint Planning.</blockquote><p dir="auto"><br>In Scrum, the development team uses their shared understanding of ‘done’ (DoD) as a filter for whether items can be realistically delivered in the sprint time box. <br></p><p>At the time of sprint planning, when items are discussed and found to not be either small enough or clear enough to be completely ‘done’ in the sprint timebox, those are not to be planned in the sprint but rather Refined more. <br></p><p>This Refinement can be done at that moment so a refined version may be realistically ‘done’ in the sprint. <br></p><p>Or the refinement can be done at a later time to learn more and potentially have refined items ready for the next sprint planning.</p>
