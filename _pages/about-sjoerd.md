I am a coach, trainer &amp; consultant working with a lean-agile mindset to help people and organizations find better ways of working; less waste, more &amp; faster value delivered and intrinsic motivation. <a href="http://sjoerdly.com/purpose/">My purpose is: "Enabling Better Outcomes through Empricism &amp; Compassion"</a>. I try my best to choose the right tool for the job, using a lean and agile approach in my work while teaching and consulting organizations on theirs. I use my knowledge and experience as Professional Scrum Trainer (scrum.org PST), SAFe Program Consultant (SAFe SPC) &amp; LeSS Practitioner when applicable, but don't hesitate to advise or work with an approach that is new to me. Never stop learning, never stop growing, stumble &amp; get on with it.

I do this together with my awesome colleagues at Prowareness - We On, the Agile Academy, Scrum.org and all the agilists in my global and local network.

As a connector and aspiring knowledge hub I try to learn together and increase knowledge and understanding of ways to improve our work effectiveness and happiness. The Product Owner Perspective (podcast) is one of the ways I try to help the community while learning myself from Product Owner practitioners around the world.
