<p>Or: a quick note on using the right language in your app (site).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Today I used the online system of my doctor to ask for a medicine I had previously got prescribed. Very nice to not have to go to the doctor or wait a long time before I get through to the doctor’s assistent. A good example of eHealth in practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a step in this process I got asked to which part of my medical file I would like to refer. I know the body part and layman term for what I need the medicine for. But not the medical term. So I had no way of figuring out which part of my own medical file I had to refer to. &nbsp;Too bad, because I guess this would have been easier for my doctor to process my request.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this? &nbsp;Don’t just write &lt;medical term&gt; when &nbsp;this only makes sense to the doctor, make sure it can be understood by all the users of the system, in particularly (in this case) the patient. Keep it simple,&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sensible.com%2Fdmmt.html&amp;t=YmVhOThlMjI3MGYzNzFjYzZiMmVhMTUyZDFmNDgyNGU5YmExODdhZiwxQ0J3S3pnbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A9bWr_sUaKYO7UZ4h6y05xA&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fsjoerdly.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F146943424207%2Fplease-use-the-language-of-the-end-user&amp;m=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t make me think</a>, and especially don’t make me confused!</p>
