<p>Why do I think team coaching is a bad idea? Dont get me wrong, I believe team coaching can have a great amount of added value. It's just that I often find that teams receive coaching while they actually should not even be a team. The Agile way of working is all about being in control in a complex environment. We get control by learning from feedback on the value delivered as quickly as possible. So we deliver Done Increments regularly in short iterations.</p>

<p>I'd like to answer that question through a metaphor. The hamburger. <em>But wait, Sjoerd, aren't you vegan? Yep, but there's some great fake burgers these days. No animals involved. Back on topic.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine: you order a Hamburger at a local hamburger joint. They tell you preparing that hamburger will take 60 minutes. (they make everything from scratch, fresh!) Recently, the kitchen made a transition to Agile delivery, so they will deliver your order in 10-minute increments. Interesting! The delivery can be in two possible ways: first the bottom bun, then the burger, then the pickles, etc. Building your Burger layer for layer. Or, you get a small bite after the first 10 minutes, but with all the ingredients in it (like a slider, a mini-burger). In this second scenario, you can immediately tell the clerk that you dislike pickles. The next delivery they can leave those out, etc. In the first scenario a result is delivered every iteration. But does a single bottom bun deliver customer value? I'd prefer a full, juicy, crispy, tasty bite. Without pickles. Please. üòâ</p>

<p>When we return from the metaphor (well-fed, hopefully) and look at the way most businesses are organized, we will discover business units similar to the components of the hamburger. When such a business 'implements Agile', they will start creating Agile Teams within those units (components). Those teams need lots of help ofcourse to become truly agile, so people like me (Scrum Masters/Agile Coaches) are hired to coach those teams. And so we end op passionately coaching team <em>bottom bun</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while coaching this team <em>bottom bun</em> may have some benefits, for instance honest feedback during Retrospectives aimed to improve as a team, this is not what Agile should primarily be about. Agile is about delivering real working product to customers, so you can validate your assumptions and adapt your course as needed. Remember? The goal of Agile is being in control in a complex environment. So long as the output delivered by team <em>bottom bun</em> is just a small part of the actual total output needed to deliver customer value, this goal is not achieved. There is no actual feedback (just more assumptions) and we will not be able to learn from our current output as well as needed to stay on course to delivering maximum value. We are actually just creating a false sense of control that is potentially steering us into the bermuda triangle of lost hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, dear Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches, are YOU coaching a team <em>bottom bun</em>? Are you avoiding the conversation about continuously moving the organization to create <em>full bite, full flavor, full</em> <em>value</em> teams? Then you are not helping the organization and the team use Agile as intended and potentially harming the organization by playing Agile theater. So should we simply refuse to help teams and organizations that are only able to start creating component teams <em>(</em>delivering<em> bottom buns</em>)? No way, this is sometimes the only place to start helping. But please don't stop there and use all impediments and dependencies you and the team will surface to push the organization and its teams towards delivering a <em>full bite</em> of value, helping them to increase their control and effectiveness using Agile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So before you start coaching an team, <em>please be aware</em> of the full hamburger and the components needed to deliver full, tasty value. So looking beyond the team you've been asked to coach, which other ingredients are needed to deliver customer value? It's truly rare to start in a perfect Agile situation, and that is ok. But never forget that it's your duty as Agile Coach or Scrum Master to help the organization to improve their way to true agility, to start delivering customer value with each team. To get the whole hamburger front and center and make it better with each delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hamburger may be a playful, lightweight analogy to start discussing true agility in your organization, to keep in mind what is really important: delivering customer value and being in control by inviting feedback and learning from it. Good luck andSucces en eet smakelijk!</p>
