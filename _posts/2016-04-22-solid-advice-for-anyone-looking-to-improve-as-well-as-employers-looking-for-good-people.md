<p>Thoughts on the linkedin pulse article: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-letter-employers-behalf-bootcamp-grads-also-tom-goldenberg">Open Letter to Employers on Behalf of Bootcamp Grads (and also to Bootcamp grads)</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this 'open letter’, Tom Goldenberg feels the need to respond to some denigrating comments on Bootcamps and their quality in the tech field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The takeaways I read however, apply to more than simply&nbsp;‘Bootcamp grads’. It all boils down to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Invest in people, not degrees. People can learn new things and grow — degrees are static.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this is great advice to employers, companies and anyone who should care about building a better, sustainable business with people at its core. (Recruiters, I know you are on Linkedin every day. Please take note.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look for the right traits and personality (resilience, grit, positivity, pragmatism, etc) instead of focusing too much on background &amp; technology fit. Oh and don’t make the mistake&nbsp;to only look for a&nbsp;‘culture’ fit. Look at each individual and each company need you’re trying to fulfill, whether they add the ingredients you need to the mix. Diversity is key!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then some advice for Bootcamp graduates, but in essence this is good, sane advice for anyone looking to improve themselves, whether looking for a job or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here are some things that have helped me keep my skills sharp and marketable while going through bootcamp:</p><p>1. Network. ... You’ll find that people generally like to be able to help others, as long as they don’t feel pressured into something.</p><p>2. Find the right compromise between passion and marketability. ... Just try to find projects that are also marketable to employers, that show what you can offer to them. ...</p><p>3. Hustle. You might get a better fit by trying to find jobs in a non-traditional manner.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever phase in your career is, these three tips can be of benefit. Networking really isn’t all that scary when you actually try it, although it can be rather hard to start. Begin by attending meetups or following a course and take it from there. Meeting new people can be a challenge to some but practice takes off the sharp edges (at least for me). Also, be pragmatic in following your passion. You won’t be able to chase that passion properly with no dough to pay the bills. ;-) This is a fine &amp; difficult balance, but good to keep an eye on when weighing options and making choices in learning &amp; developing yourself. Then finally, combining the first two tips; use any way you can to find new opportunities. Tell people about your passion, what your dream job would look like, and what kind of companies or employers you’s love to work for. Whether you meet them in purposeful networking, doing volunteer work or when you’re talking to that wacky aunt who’s got nothing in common with you. Share your story and be surprised what you may find...</p>
