<p>June 1st, I will be starting a new, exciting part of my Agile journey by joining&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fprowareness.nl&amp;t=NDE0YjY4Mzc2Mzc4NzE5YjY0ZGM3ZGM4ZDg0NTU1YjY0ZmU2NzMwMywya0lycWZPeQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A9bWr_sUaKYO7UZ4h6y05xA&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fsjoerdly.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F144551801207%2Fdeparture-a-new-chapter-in-my-agile-journey&amp;m=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prowareness</a>. I am very excited about this, and you will probably hear more about it soon. However, a new employment often goes together with breaking up with a former employer. In my case, I see it as&nbsp;a friendly break up. Below is the mail I sent out to my soon-to-be former colleagues; the ones who deserve heaps of kudos &amp; gratefulness for helping me on the Capgemini part of my professional journey for the past years.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Leaving Capgemini - A new chapter in my Agile journey</strong></p><p>Dear colleagues,</p><p>Soon I will be leaving Capgemini, after having the pleasure of working here for almost 5 years. In the past years I have been given the opportunity to grow from a full stack web developer (Hippo, Java, front end, etc) into a Scrum Master, Agile Coach, Community (re)starter, Blogger &amp; Trainer. The majority of which I was able to do in collaboration with enthusiastic, smart &amp; friendly colleagues in a challenging work environment. I am thankful to you all for this!&nbsp;</p><p>Special shoutouts to all the people doing it for the &lt;3 &amp; passion. You give me great energy; DCX Bloggers old and new, Agile CTG! enthusiasts, Capgemini networkers, etc. You know who you are. Kudos!</p><p>…</p><p>Hope to meet again &amp; with happy greetings,</p><p>Sjoerd</p></blockquote>
