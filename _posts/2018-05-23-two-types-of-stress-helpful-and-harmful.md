<p dir="auto">Stress is often seen as unilaterally bad. We should avoid it if we want to stay healthy and burn-out results of being stressed for too long at a time.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are two sides to this coin. Stress can be either helpful or harmful. The harmful type is called ‘distress’. This is the type to avoid. This is what is often meant when people use the general term ‘stress’.</p>
<p dir="auto">The more interesting type though, is ‘eustress’. This is the kind of stress that gives you an adrenalin shot, leading to proved reaction skills and learning. This is the zone where we learn fastest and most deeply. This is why we make training challenging hard, and why we at prowareness are looking for ‘stretch’ all the time. Always looking for that new thing that is just uncomfortable enough to feel a slight hesitation. And then deliberately attempt a first time outside our comfort zone.</p>
<p dir="auto">Like pippi longstocking stated: “I’ve never done that before, so I think I can do it.”</p>
<p dir="auto">When we stretch without breaking, we stay in the eustress zone and improve optimally. Just outside our comfort zone, without losing sight of it. Have you been taking it easy lately? Where can you look for eustress experiences? Where is your stretch?</p>
