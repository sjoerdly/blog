I am a coach, trainer &amp; consultant working with a lean-agile mindset to help people and organizations find better ways of working; less waste, more &amp; faster value delivered and intrinsic motivation. I try my best to choose the right tool for the job, using a lean and agile approach in my work while teaching and consulting organizations on theirs. I use my knowledge and experience as Professional Scrum Trainer (scrum.org PST), SAFe Program Consultant (SAFe SPC) &amp; LeSS Practitioner when applicable, but don't hesitate to advise or work with an approach that is new to me. Never stop learning, never stop growing, stumble & get on with it.
