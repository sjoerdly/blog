Scrum is built upon Empiricism. The three pillars of empiricism are firmly embedded in various parts of Scrum. Which is why we spend a serious amount of attention to Empiricism (and complexity) in any Scrum related training. So if your Scrum feels like a waste of time or ineffective, start inspection at the basics. How is your Scrum serving empiricism?
<h1>Empiricism in Scrum</h1>
<h2>Artifacts</h2>
The Scrum artifacts should serve transparency.
<ul>
 	<li>The Increment (the constantly improved Product we are developing);</li>
 	<li>The Product Backlog (list of all that may be valuable to do in the future);</li>
 	<li>The Sprint Backlog (list of items that we are expecting to deliver this Sprint).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scrum events</h2>
The Scrum events are for inspection &amp; adaptation of the artifacts &amp; the process itself.
<ul>
 	<li>Sprint;</li>
 	<li>Sprint Planning;</li>
 	<li>Daily Scrum;</li>
 	<li>Sprint Review;</li>
 	<li>Sprint Retrospective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scrum roles</h2>
The Scrum roles are about accountability of empiricism in certain distinct areas (to prevent conflict of interest a.o.).
<ul>
 	<li>Product Owner: Value;</li>
 	<li>Development Team: done increment;</li>
 	<li>Scrum Master: scrum &amp; continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Scrum without Empiricism is not Effective</h1>
There is no sense in doing Scrum without understanding Empiricism. Does your team get this? Your Product Owner? Your Development Team members? Does your Scrum Master know what Empiricism entails and how it is fundamental to continuous improvement in Scrum? If not, discuss this (for instance in a Sprint Retrospective) with your Scrum Team and build from there.
